SudoBot was started as a way to make fetching and sharing commonly used information easier in the [Ask Ubuntu General](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/201/ask-ubuntu-general-room) room, similar to the way [ubottu](http://ubottu.com/) works in #ubuntu on IRC.

SudoBot is based on [SO-ChatBot](https://github.com/Zirak/SO-ChatBot) by Zirak, although most of the noisier, less useful commands have been removed.
